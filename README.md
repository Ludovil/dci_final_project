## An Airbnb for non-professional musicians

This application is dedicated to non-professional musicians who want to expand their music beyond their hometown, play in new places, even far from home, without having to worry about finding a place to sleep or carrying pounds of gear.

1. Your band just found a date 100 km away from your rehearsal room. Look for a band equivalent to yours among the users and see what they propose as a solution in terms of sleeping arrangements and equipment. If it works, this same band will be able to count on you in a similar situation.

2. You have a date planned in your area. You can propose a group that belongs to your network to do the oppening act and offer them sleeping arrangement and equipment, and in return they will do the same for your band on a future occasion.
